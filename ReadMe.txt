-PiedPyro is a software solution for communicating with DIY raspberry pi based firing systems for pyrotechnics.
This is the windows-native version of the software built in Visual Studio in C#.  

-There is also a iPhone and iPad version written in Python and intended to be run in Pythonista that I have built.  
Check them out under the repository PiedPyro Python iPad & PiedPyro Python iPhone.  The Python server side of the 
application is also listed under a repository labeled Raspberry-Pi-Firing-System.
